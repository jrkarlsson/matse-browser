# Todo
- Responsive UI
- Memoized selectors
- Api calls
- Normalization
  - Add parent to categories
  - Add id path to categories
- Navigation(Breadcrumbs)
- Clean up nomenclature(singular/plural)
- Error handling?

# Fixed
- Fix CORS (not much to fix, use browser extension to circumvent or enable the mocks in api.js)
- Fix empty/loading states (Loading states atleast)


# CategoryTree
It is a bit odd to load the entire tree, maybe there are use cases that I don't see. But I don't think most users will explore
the entire tree fully, thus it would be better to only load the categories the user is interested in.
Either that or load it once and then handle any potential sync issues when the tree in backend diverge from the one in the state.
